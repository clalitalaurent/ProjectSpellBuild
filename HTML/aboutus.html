                <div class="feature">
                    There's 3 main of SpellBuild's game feature and option : 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Save the World
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                Save the World is a cooperative, mission-based game of survival in a destructible world. You play with up to three other people on a randomly generated map to fight against a storm, rescue survivors, build structures, craft weapons, find loot, and upgrade and expand a shield device to protect your base of operations.
                            </ul>

                        </li> <br>
                        <li>
                            Battle Royale
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                Battle Royale is the Player versus Player, or PvP. You and 99 other players start off in a flying battle bus, find a landing spot, then race to collect materials, weapons, and other loot to defeat the other players.<br>For the Solo game modes, it’s you against 99 other players. (See the following figure.) For Duos, you can team up with a friend (or friendly stranger) against 49 other teams of two. In Duos, your partner can revive you if you’re wounded. For Squads, you join a team of three other players and try and be the last of 25 four-player teams standing.
                            </ul>
                        </li> <br>
                        <li>Creative
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                                In Creative mode, you gain access to your own private island, where you can pretty much design or do whatever you want, including inviting your friends over for some playtesting. You’ll have all kinds of materials at your disposal, so you can do more than just build structures.<br>You can save and load your creations, so you’re free to be as creative, or destructive, as you like.
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Basic mechanics of SpellBuild:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lightweight gives the player a constant mobility multiplier of 1.07x.</li>
                        <li>Marathon doubles the player's sprint duration, and its Pro version gives the player unlimited sprint duration.</li>
                        <li>Movement speed can be modified in Creative mode, to make the player move faster or slower. The player can multiply the movement speed by up to 200%.</li>
                        <li>Also because of the perk modifiers, a player can modify Lightweight for incredible speeds.</li>
                        <li>While sprinting, it is possible to Dive to Prone.</li>
                    </ul>
